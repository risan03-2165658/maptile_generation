## [Website Link](https://risan-2165658.github.io/maptile_generation-1/)
In this project, I have creates 4 title maps, including tilesets to display a basemap of Japan,
modified basemap of Japan, Earthquake in Japan on a modified basemap, and tilemap4 with shows the trails in Japan 
to highlight escape past in the nature. All titlesets have a minimum zoom of 3 and maximum zoom of 10.

> Custom basemap that I created by modifying the colors and font from the default [Mapbox Monochrome Style](https://docs.mapbox.com/studio-manual/guides/map-styling/).

> A map that showcases various trails in King County. Data was collected from [King County GIS Open Data](https://gis-kingcounty.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/c9ba67806d344c95aedec74c73d0b81e_273/explore?location=47.430889%2C-121.777100%2C10.32).

> Made in combination with the first two tilesets.

> A special tileset created with Mapbox used to highlight the nature aspect of the King County area. I tried my best to highlight the 'outdoors' aspects of Seattle with the color scheme and by minimizing other aspects while trying to maximize details towards greener areas. The reason I picked this topic is because Washington is known for having great places to hike.# Mapping with Tilesets
